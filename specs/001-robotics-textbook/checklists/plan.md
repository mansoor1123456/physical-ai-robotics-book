# Plan Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Purpose**: Validate implementation plan completeness and quality before proceeding to task generation.
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Feature**: [specs/001-robotics-textbook/spec.md](specs/001-robotics-textbook/spec.md)
**Plan**: [specs/001-robotics-textbook/plan.md](specs/001-robotics-textbook/plan.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Plan aligns with all requirements in `spec.md`
- [x] Technical context is clear and justified
- [x] Roles for AI and human intervention are clearly defined
- [x] Operational policies are addressed (AI interpretation, quality validation, review, approval)

## Plan Completeness

- [x] All modules, chapters, and tasks are broken down as required
- [x] Milestones and dependencies are clearly outlined (without specific deadlines)
- [x] File organization strategy is defined and consistent
- [x] All necessary external dependencies (hardware, software) are identified
- [x] Risk analysis and mitigation strategies are included
- [x] All Constitution Check items are addressed and justified
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

## Plan Actionability

- [x] Each phase and task is actionable (can be translated into concrete steps)
- [x] Plan supports cloud execution without manual intervention for AI tasks
- [x] Provides sufficient detail for `/sp.tasks` to generate actionable tasks
- [x] ADR suggestions are appropriate and well-justified

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require plan updates before proceeding to `/sp.tasks`.
