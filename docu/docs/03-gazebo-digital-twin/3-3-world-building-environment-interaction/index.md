### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this chapter, students will be able to:
- Create custom Gazebo world files, configuring physics and environmental properties.
- Integrate static and dynamic models into a simulated environment, including custom primitives.
- Add and configure various environmental elements such as lights and terrains.
- Understand how to interact with objects in the Gazebo environment, both manually and programmatically.
- Apply materials and textures to models for enhanced visual realism.
