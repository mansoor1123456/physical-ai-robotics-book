### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the fundamental architectural differences and improvements of ROS 2 over ROS 1, particularly concerning real-time capabilities and distributed systems.
2.  Describe the role of Data Distribution Service (DDS) as the middleware in ROS 2 and how Quality of Service (QoS) policies influence communication.
3.  Utilize core ROS 2 command-line tools (`ros2 run`, `ros2 topic`, `ros2 node`) and graphical introspection tools (`rqt`) to manage and monitor ROS 2 systems.
4.  Understand the basic concepts of security in ROS 2 (SROS 2), including authentication and authorization.
5.  Set up a ROS 2 workspace, create basic packages, and run introductory ROS 2 applications.
